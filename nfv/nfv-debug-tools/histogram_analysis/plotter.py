# Description: Graphs nfv-vim histogram data from CSV files to html page and saves
#              saves it locally.
#
# Behaviour   : The script takes in arguments from the command line such as specific
#               process names, or the name of a grouping of processes, and graphs
#               them in a local html file using plotly. The x-axis displays
#               datestamps corresponding to when the sample in the csv file was taken,
#               and the y-axis displays either the average execution time of the
#               processes during each sample, or the difference in total hits that
#               process experienced from one sample period to the previous sample
#               period. Both average execution times and the delta hit count can
#               be displayed on the same graph using two y-axes. The CSV files must
#               be generated prior to running this script by running Histogram.sh.
#               A config called logplot.cfg will be generated the first time this
#               script is run and will automatically populate itself with all processes
#               listed in the csv/ directory. Change the N to a Y in the right column
#               of the config file to have that process graphed when running this script
#               via config settings. Groupings of processes can also be made under the
#               groups section by following the same N/Y format as above. When a group
#               name is specified all processes listed under that group name will be
#               graphed if they have a Y in their right-column.
#
# To run this script ensure that plotly is installed.
# To do this enter: sudo pip install plotly
#
#
# If no arguments are entered when running this script it will default to running
# the proceses in logplot.cfg with a Y in their rightmost column, and will display
# the average execution time on the y-axis for all available samples.
